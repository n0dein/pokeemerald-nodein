# Pokémon Emerald Game Corner Expansion

Hello! This is a tweaked version of Chris Piche's Game Corner Expansion feature branch made by me, AGSMGMaster64.
Currently, this adds a new config file that uses some flags by default but can be configured to other flags if necessary.
Some new music and changes to the Mauville Corner have been made as well, so keep that in mind if you plan to merge this into your
existing project. Credits to AsparagusEduardo for the basis of this merge here, I just mainly tweaked things around to help
out any developers who may want to use this as well.

<!-- If you want to re-record or change these gifs, here are some notes that I used: https://files.catbox.moe/05001g.md -->

**`pokeemerald-expansion`** is a GBA ROM hack base that equips developers with a comprehensive toolkit for creating Pokémon ROM hacks. **`pokeemerald-expansion`** is built on top of [pret's `pokeemerald`](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. **It is not a playable Pokémon game on its own.** 

# [Features](FEATURES.md)

**`pokeemerald-expansion`** offers hundreds of features from various [core series Pokémon games](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Core_series), along with popular quality-of-life enhancements designed to streamline development and improve the player experience. A full list of those featues can be found in [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md).

Below is the rest of the original description from Chris Piche himself:

More specifically, this adds 4 pinball mini-games, Flappy Bird, Block Stacker, Snake, Blackjack, Voltorb Flip, Plinko, Mauville Derby, and Gacha Machines into the Game Corner.

Big thank you to huderlem (Pokemon Pinball to Emerald), and Pokeabbie (Voltorb Flip from Emerald Rogue). All I really did for these was some graphics, music, and code to work with coins. They deserve the real credits here.
Also thank you to Viperio, who made an initial Snake for Pokemon Emerald that I based my code on.
